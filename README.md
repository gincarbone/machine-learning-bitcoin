## machine-learning-bitcoin
...Is a machine learning LSTM model to predict Bitcoin prices of netx month. For pricing it needs historical bitcoin price data from 2015 to date.
The designed neural network is an adaptation of the one used in the course "Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks" but with the increase in the number of 64 neurons in the Hidden Layers. Thanks for this!
Some changes have been made to the Python script in order to configure the main things in the first lines of code.
